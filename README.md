> **Note (November 2025):** This extension is not yet available on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
> To install it, download the latest `.vsix` package from the [Releases page](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio-vscode/releases) and use **Extensions → … → Install from VSIX…** in VS Code.

This official extension by the Apio team brings Apio’s power directly into VS Code with **one-click buttons** and a **dedicated sidebar panel**. Common commands (`lint`, `build`, `upload`) appear on the status bar, while the full command set is organized in a collapsible tree under the **Apio** tab.
